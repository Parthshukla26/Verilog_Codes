## Introduction

This project aims to provide a structured approach to learning RTL design by completing daily coding challenges, projects, and exercises. Each day features a new concept or project, ranging from basic circuits to more complex designs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- A compatible simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado, or any RTL simulation tool)
- Hardware description language (HDL) knowledge (Verilog/VHDL)
- Basic understanding of digital circuits

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rtl-100-days-code.git
cd rtl-100-days-code
